# Team_Profile_Generator-ZF

[video walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V8bSUDLOsigOIdQiUk6GvC4AwpLP2bFq/view)

In this project, I created a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

I used a command-line application that accepts user input through command prompts that gather user information and displays in an HTML file
In the HTML file, a user can click on an email address in the HTML to email the employee
In the HTML file, a user can click on the github username in the HTML to access the employee's github profile
When the application is started, the user is promted to enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address and office number
The user is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or intern or to finish building the team
When the user selects the engineer or intern option, the user is promoted to enter the engineer/interns name, ID, email, engineer's github username, and interns school, and then be taken back to the menu.
When the user is finsihed building the team, the HTML is generated
